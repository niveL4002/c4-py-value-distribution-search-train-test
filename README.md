hello!
This is a python project for testing ideas regarding game tree search.
The game used is connect four for simplicity.
The search algorithm is and based on probabilistic best first search.
It uses discrete value distributions instead of scalars.
A simple (slow!!) neural network is implemented (with for python-loops xD).
The training skript runs selfplay games, validation matches and stores the networks in folder.
with main.py you can play against the latest (best) net if available.

Currents Project State:
    initial state but inactive
    - the search seems to be working ok.
    - the network seems to working.
    - training the net however leads to no success in the validation games (why?)

(pls share bugfixes, ideas and recommendations regarding this project)
